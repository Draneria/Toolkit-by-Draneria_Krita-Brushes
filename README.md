### This is a set of brushes that emulate metallic effects, for [Krita.](https://github.com/KDE/krita)

Hello everyone!

I hope you are all having a lovely 2025 so far :space_invader:
<br>
This is a set of utilities for making 3D paint effects, to compliment your normal brushes.

:magic_wand: Features :magic_wand:
<br>
<br>

*    Introducing the Sandpaper Rub, the worlds-first RGBA eraser!!
*    Add universal RGBA to any brushstroke.
*    You can also flatten paint that you have thickened.

<br>

Using filters to make paint look 3D is nothing new e.g. emboss and heightmaps. However! I find these more convenient. They also give you better control, and who doesn’t want more of that in life✨

⚜️ Installation ⚜️

    1. Install Krita, if not already done.
    
    2. Go to “Settings” and press “Manage Resources Libraries…”.
    
    3. Press “Import” then select the .bundle file.
    
    4. Restart Krita, and enjoy!

:gear: How to Use :gear:
<br>
<br>

Think of them like precision filters -
<br>
  * Paint as you would normally
  * Use a toolkit brush on top to add RGBA
  * “Sandpaper Rub” works like any other eraser!
<br>

They are also experimental - especially the paint flatten effect. Your mileage may vary (ノ゜▽゜)ノ

  *  In the diagram below, I used “Wet Large Old Brush” from clooms Dry & Dirty [Bundle](https://krita-artists.org/t/dry-dirty-bundle/82826) which I think is absolutely fantastic for traditional effects!

  *  The brush used to demonstrate “Sandpaper Rub” is Memileo’s lovely impastos, [WIP version](https://krita-artists.org/t/rotating-light-brushtips-wip/64930).

  *  In the poster, I used “Dra) Acrylic; Brush - Basic” from [here](https://ko-fi.com/s/34855720b1).

Thank you for reading (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) I thought it might be nice to put together something small as I work on Metallics 2.0 and Acrylics, even if these are specialised. Still, I hope you enjoy!

P.S For anyone who is double curious, I have wrote a couple extra things too:

<br>

💡Bonus Tips💡
<br>
<br>
* The brushes need a liiiiiiiitle texture of any kind to do their magic, so nothing will happen on flat colours.
* The "Add Thickener (height)" will create odd colours on areas that are not opaque, the solution is to lock your layer's transparency.
* Brush opacity has a big effect on results! You can test out different % to tailor them to your pressure comfort level.
<br>

🧪 More Notes 🧪
<br>
<br>
I think the eraser is a unique solution for having a brush that can be affected by the texture of your brushstrokes. In this case, through the filter engine via edge-detection. It’s not perfect, but it’s certainly interesting (to me anyway) xD

As for adding universal RGBA, I think the “height” one has the most realistic result, although its subtle. Lock transparency with that brush!
